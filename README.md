# bomhttps
Redirects requests for the Bureau of Meteorology website to their little-known https server at https://reg.bom.gov.au to avoid the "HTTPS not supported" page.

The only difference between the Chrome/Edge/Opera version and the Firefox one is that firefox required an extra section in the Manifest file that Chrome and friends throw an error on, so they are separate.
